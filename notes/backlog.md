Ideas and future work, not yet planned.

### Issue: Output tokens may not be correct
I got an error on a long "thinking" session saying:
API Error: Claude's response exceeded the 32000 output token maximum. To configure this behavior, set the CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS environment variable.

And checking the output at this time in the CLI it says "output 1.4k". This is a clear discrepancy
